Jens:

Good:

-I remembered more about Javascript than I thought I knew, which made me a lot more comfortable for the coming month

-I worked hard to get my assignments done early instead of slacking off because it was 'easy'.


Bad:

-After finishing the week's assignments, I didn't really work on next week's assignments or my portfolio at all, when this would have been an excellent time to do so.

-A lot of the work I did was in the evening instead of during the day. I could do with a less erratic work-flow.
