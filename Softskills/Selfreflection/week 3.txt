Good:

Knowledge:
I had a clear idea of what was needed to complete the assignment, and I wasn't too far off either.

Teamwork:
I think the cooperation with groupmembers and a few others outside it has been pretty solid


Bad:
Poor time management:
Keeping focus while working from home is a lot harder, and I lost focus completely thursday causing a stressful friday.

Overly detailed:
I spent a lot of time trying to get small details right before moving on with the general assignment, which I should have done the other way around to reduce stress.
