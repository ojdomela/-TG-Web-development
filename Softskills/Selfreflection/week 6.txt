Jens
Two things that went well:
I already had a strong understanding of the topics for this week, and I was able to help other people understand it too.
Our group worked together very well, I think
Two things that could go better:
I didn’t finish my own assignments for the week on time. I could have spent more time on it earlier in the week, and then didn’t have a lot of time later in the week for personal reasons. If I had worked on it harder earlier it would still not have been an issue.
Communication in the group wasn’t always available because I created the google meet, so the times I wasn’t there nobody could enter / there was less teamwork within the group as a result
